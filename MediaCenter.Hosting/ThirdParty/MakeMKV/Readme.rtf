{\pard Thank you for trying out MakeMKV beta. MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter or "transcoder". The only thing it does (and does well) - it converts the video clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) disk into a set of MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters. There are lots of players that can play MKV files nearly on all platforms.

{\pard MakeMKV BETA has several restrictions. Firstly, it is time-limited -- it will stop functioning after 60 days. You can always download the latest version from makemkv.com that will reset the expiration date.
\par}
{\pard On Windows platform computer administrator privileges are required to run. This is limitation of Windows SCSI application programming interface. Eventually MakeMKV will not require administrator privileges to run.
